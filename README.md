# olc::PGE for Mac (Deprecated)

####This implementation currently does not work, but a new version (with PGE 2.0) is being made that will be compatible with mac.

The [PixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine), by [OneLoneCoder](https://onelonecoder.com/), has finally been fully ported to Mac! The dependencies that you must have are:

  - Cocoa framework (Installed with developer tools)
  - Quartz framework (Installed with developer tools)
  - OpenGL 3.0 (Installed with developer tools)
  - libpng (May be installed with [brew](https://brew.sh/))

That's it! This implementation of the library uses the native Cocoa api for Mac, using a modified library from [xslattery](https://github.com/xslattery/Cocoa-OpenGL-Windowing-Lib).

#### Example:

## Installation

### Xcode Installation

First, make sure you have Xcode, and if not, download it. All you need to get the project up and running in Xcode is to use the Shell script called, "setup.sh". Make sure you have all of the dependencies installed:

```sh
$ cd olcPGEMac
$ ./setup.sh
```
Then, you should open up Xcode (you should quit it if it is already open) and "Create a new Xcode Project". In the macOS tab, you should see a OneLoneCoder section with a PGE app:

Once you name your app, and save it, open the App folder. Inside is the main.cpp file. Build it first to make sure it works!

### Usage for those whom hate Xcode

If you do not want to use Xcode, then simply go inside the OneLoneCoder folder. Go in to the terminal and type this:

```sh
$ cd OneLoneCoder/PGE\ App.xctemplate
$ make
```

You should end up with a file called 'ouput'. It should open a window like this:
